# This workflow replaces the semantic-release configuration from .releaserc.json
# It runs on every push to the main branch and performs:
# - Commit analysis to determine the next version
# - Version updates in docker-compose files
# - Changelog generation
# - GitHub release creation
# - Docker image build and push to GitHub Container Registry
